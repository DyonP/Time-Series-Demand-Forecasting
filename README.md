# Time-Series-Demand-Forecasting
The airline daily passengers are predicted by using LSTM model.

The dataset is based on the International Airline Passengers dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/airline-passengers.csv).  
Here is the tutorial of the dataset (https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/).
